# Payment System: Business Case & OOP Implementation

This demonstrates how ALL OOP concepts work together in a real-world payment processing system:
- Classes and Objects: Foundation structure for payment entities
- Encapsulation: Data protection and controlled access for financial security
- Inheritance: Code reuse and specialization for different payment types
- Polymorphism: Same interface, different behaviors for flexible payment processing
- Abstraction: Simple interfaces hiding complex payment workflows
- Composition: Objects containing other objects for complex relationships
- Aggregation: Objects using other objects without owning them

## üè¢ Business Problem & Use Case

### Background: Fintech Startup Challenge

**Your Role**: Sr Developer + Architect + QA
 - **Company Context:**
   - **PayEasy**: 25 person fintech startup
   - **Your tile**: Senior Software Engineer (but you are the entire tech team)
   - **Reporting to**: CEO directly
   - **Supporting**: 5 Customer support staff, 2 product managers, finance team
   - **Current System**: Built by previous developer who left 6 months ago (Link to legacy code:)

**Scenario**: You are the lead developer at "PayEasy", a growing fintech startup. The CEO comes to you with an urgent problem: 
*"We started with just credit card processing, but now customers want debit cards, digital wallets, crypto payments and international forex cards. Our current system is a mess - every time we add a new payment method, we have to rewrite half the codebase. We are losing customers to competitors who can integrate new payment methods in days, not months. We need a scalable, maintainable solution that can grow with use."*

### Business Requirements
1. **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support credit cards, debit cards, digital wallets, forex cards and cryptocurriences
2. **Easy Extensibility**: Add new payment types without breaking existing code
