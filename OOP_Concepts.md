COMPLETE PAYMENT SYSTEM - ALL OOP CONCEPTS EXPLAINED LINE BY LINE

This demonstrates how ALL OOP concepts work together in a real-world payment processing system:
- Classes and Objects: Foundation structure for payment entities
- Encapsulation: Data protection and controlled access for financial security
- Inheritance: Code reuse and specialization for different payment types
- Polymorphism: Same interface, different behaviors for flexible payment processing
- Abstraction: Simple interfaces hiding complex payment workflows
- Composition: Objects containing other objects for complex relationships
- Aggregation: Objects using other objects without owning them

BUSINESS PROBLEM SOLVED:
A fintech company needs a payment processing system that can handle multiple payment methods
(credit cards, debit cards, digital wallets, international cards, cryptocurrencies) while
ensuring security, maintainability, and easy extensibility for future payment types.
