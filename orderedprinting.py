Problem Statement: Ordered Number Printing Using 3 Threads

You are asked to implement a multithreaded solution where three threads work together to print numbers from 1 to 50, in increasing order, one number at a time.

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
	â€¢	Print numbers from 1 to 50, inclusive.
	â€¢	Use three threads to perform the printing.
	â€¢	The output on the console must be in sequential order: 1 2 3 4 ... 50
	â€¢	The numbers must not be printed out of order or skipped.
"""

"""
Approach: 
- need to coordinate three threads such that only one prints at a time.
- numbers are printed in order or in sequence
- There will be a shared variable to track the current number to print. 
- Lock is used to ensure that only one thread can print at a time (one thread to access a block of code or data at a time). It doens't necessarily see the order of execution.
  Lock alone ensures mutual exclusion but not the order of in which threads gets to print. So if we only use locks thread execution order is not guaranteed. We will need more logic.
- Condition lets threads wait until some condition becomes true and allows waking up other threads. So condition alone is not enough to solve this because Condition must be used with a Lock 
  (either explicitly or implicitly). It requires a lock to work correctly.
- what Condition does:
	â€¢	It allows threads to wait until they are notified.
	â€¢	It uses the associated lock to: Ensure mutual exclusion while checking conditions or modifying shared variables.
        Block/unblock threads in a coordinated way using wait() and notify()
